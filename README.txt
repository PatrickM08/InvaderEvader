Hello!
This is an old school project from sixth form, please ignore the comments those were left for teachers.
There is a lot of bad code in here, this was started in year 12 and I had to add a large number of unnecessary techniques to appease the course work criteria.
To run this code you need to have pygame installed. Run the maincode module and go to the register page to play the game.
Have fun, Thank you.
