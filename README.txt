Hello! Thank you for considering my application.
This is an old school project from before university, please ignore the comments those were left for teachers.
There is a lot of bad coding practices in here, however I have grown since this project.
To run this code you need to have pygame installed. Run the maincode module and go to the register page to play the game.
Have fun, Thank you.
